# Facelift
### What?
Adds layered facial details to pawns in a vanilla art style, prioritizing performance, allowing animation to be toned back to basics or disabled entirely for those on weaker systems.

### Why?
Sure there's an existing mod for face details and animation, but it's nowhere near flexible enough to easily support expansion and compatibility for modded heads that do not have features where the human ones would be. I'm also a huge fan of providing alternatives.

### Current State
#### Done
- Basic Face Layers (Blush, Eyes, Brow, Mouth, etc)

#### Not Done
- Face Customization
- Age States
- Facial States (Animation)
- Fleshed Out Variations (Very few currently implemented)
- Mod Compatibility (Functionality anyway)

### FAQ
#### Is this ready to use?
Fuck no, but I have no doubt some of you will try anyway.
#### How does this handle modded heads?
By simply ignoring them if they aren't patched. They'll default to vanilla behaviour if they aren't set up to be handled.
#### How is this better for performance?
It might not be! I'm only human and it may end up worse with some mod combinations. However I'm making a point of at least trying to make it as performant as possible.
#### What mods will this natively support? (a.k.a "Which mods will be patched by you, slave?")
Only the ones I use, if I don't use it then I don't give a fuck.
